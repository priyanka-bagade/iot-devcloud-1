This solution detects characters within the input image and outputs text.\n",

    "This sample application includes an example for the following:\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - Video and image input is supported using OpenCV\n",
    "- Intel DevCloud Intel® DevCloud for the Edge:\n",
    "  - Submitting inference as jobs that are performed on different edge compute nodes (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter* notebook)\n",

    "  - Viewing results and assessing performance for hardware on different compute nodes\n",

    "## OCR application\n",
    "The OCR application uses the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform inference on an input image to recognize characters.  We will setup, run, and view the results for this application for several different hardware devices (CPU. GPU, etc.) available on the compute nodes within the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge.  To accomplish this, we will be performing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) to create the inference model IR files needed to perform inference\n",
    "2. Create the job file used to submit running inference on compute nodes\n",
    "3. Submit jobs for different compute nodes and monitor the job status until complete\n",
    "4. View results and assess performance \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "At startup the OCR application configures itself by parsing the command line arguments.  Once configured, the application loads the specified inference model's IR files into the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) and runs inference on the specified input image to recognize text characters.  The recognized text is then output to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the application on the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge, a job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.  After inference on the input is completed, the output is stored in the appropriate `results/<JobNum>/` directory.  The results are then viewed within this Jupyter* Notebook using Python* code to display the contents of the output text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application and inference code for this sample is already implemented in the Python* file [`ocr_sample.py`](./ocr_sample.py).\n",

    "The Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit includes the [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html) used to convert and optimize trained models into the Intermediate Representation (IR) model files, and the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) that uses the IR model files to run inference on hardware devices.  The IR model files can be created from trained models from popular frameworks (e.g. Caffe\\*, TensorFlow\\*, etc.). For this sample, the frozen TensorFlow* model from the [CRNN for Scene Text Recognition](https://github.com/MaybeShewill-CV/CRNN_Tensorflow) is supplied in the file `model/crnn.pb`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The `model/crnn.pb` file will need to be optimized using the Model Optimizer to create the necessary IR files.  We will be running the inference model on different hardware devices which have different requirements on the precision of the model (see [Inference Engine Supported Model Formats](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_supported_plugins_Supported_Devices.html#supported_model_formats) for details).

    "- **--o** : Output directory where to store the generated IR model files\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete command will look like the following:\n",
