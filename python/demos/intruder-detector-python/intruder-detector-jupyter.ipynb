    "# Intruder Detector\n",
    "\n",
    "This application is one of a series of IoT reference implementations illustrating how to develop a working solution for a problem. The reference implementation demonstrates how to create a smart video IoT solution using Intel® hardware and software tools. This solution detects any number of objects in a designated area, providing the number of objects in the frame and total count.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of how it works\n",
    "At start-up the sample application reads the equivalent of command line arguments and loads a network and image from the video input to the Inference Engine (IE) plugin. A job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.\n",
    "After the inference is completed, the output videos are appropriately stored in the /results/[device] directory, which can then be viewed within the Jupyter Notebook instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demonstration objectives\n",
    "* Video as input is supported using **OpenCV**\n",
    "* Inference performed on edge hardware (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter notebook)\n",
    "* **OpenCV** provides the bounding boxes, labels and other information\n",
    "* Visualization of the resulting bounding boxes"

    "\n",
    "### The Config File\n",
    "\n",
    "The resources/conf.txt contains the path to the video that will be used by the application, followed by the labels to be detected on video. All labels (intruders) defined will be detected on video.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of the conf.txt file is of the form ``video: <path/to/video>`` or ``intruder: <label>``.<br>\n",
    "The labels used in the conf.txt file must coincide with the labels from the labels file.\n",
