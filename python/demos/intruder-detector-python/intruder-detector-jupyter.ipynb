    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample application demonstrates how a smart video IoT solution may be created using Intel® hardware and software tools to perform intruder detection.  This solution detects any number of objects within a video frame and for each detected object of interest (an intruder):\n",
    "- Draws a box around the detected object\n",
    "- Reports the object label, time detected, and camera source in a log window and log file\n",
    "- Saves a snapshot image of the frame\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "This sample application includes an example for the following:\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - Video and image input is supported using OpenCV\n",
    "  - OpenCV is used to draw bounding boxes around detected objects, labels, and other information\n",
    "  - Visualization of the resulting bounding boxes in the output\n",
    "- Intel® DevCloud for the Edge:\n",
    "  - Submitting inference as jobs that are performed on different edge compute nodes (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter* notebook)\n",
    "  - Monitoring job status\n",
    "  - Viewing results and assessing performance for hardware on different compute nodes\n",
    "- [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit](https://software.intel.com/openvino-toolkit):\n",
    "  - Create the necessary Intermediate Representation (IR) files for the inference model using the [Model Downloader](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_tools_downloader_README.html) and [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html)\n",

    "## Intruder detector demo\n",
    "The intruder detector application uses the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform inference on an input video to locate an intruder within each frame.  We will setup, run, and view the results for this application for several different hardware devices (CPU. GPU, etc.) available on the compute nodes within the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge.  To accomplish this, we will be performing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [Model Downloader](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_tools_downloader_README.html) to download the inference model IR files needed to perform inference\n",
    "2. Create the job file used to submit running inference on compute nodes\n",
    "3. Submit jobs for different compute nodes and monitor the job status until complete\n",
    "4. View results and assess performance \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "At startup the intruder detector application configures itself by parsing the command line arguments, reading a configuration file, and reading a labels file.  Once configured, the application loads the specified inference model's IR files into the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) and runs inference on the specified input image or video to detect objects.  The label for each detected object is compared against the list of labels that were specified as an \"intruder\".  When an intruder is detected, a box is drawn around the object on the output image, the intruder is reported with time, and a snapshot of the output image is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the application on the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge, a job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.  After inference on the input is completed, the output is stored in the appropriate `/results/<jobID>/` directory.  The results are then viewed within this Jupyter* Notebook using the `videoHTML` video playback utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application and inference code for this sample is already implemented in the two Python* files: [`intruder-detector.py`](./intruder-detector.py) and [`inference.py`](./inference.py).\n",
    "\n",
