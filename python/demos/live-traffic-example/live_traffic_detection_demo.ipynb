    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample application demonstrates how a smart video IoT solution may be created using Intel® hardware and software tools to perform traffic detection.  This solution detects any number of vehicles within a video frame and records the location for each, class identifier, probability value, and time stamp.  A second pass takes the recorded data to render an output video where each vehicle has a box drawn around it with a label showing the class identifier and probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "This sample application includes an example for the following:\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - Video and image input is supported using OpenCV\n",
    "  - OpenCV is used to draw bounding boxes around detected objects, labels, and other information\n",
    "  - Visualization of the resulting bounding boxes in the output\n",
    "- Intel® DevCloud for the Edge:\n",
    "  - Submitting inference as jobs that are performed on different edge compute nodes (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter* notebook)\n",
    "  - Monitoring job status\n",
    "  - Viewing results and assessing performance for hardware on different compute nodes\n",
    "- [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit](https://software.intel.com/openvino-toolkit):\n",
    "  - Create the necessary Intermediate Representation (IR) files for the inference model using the [Model Downloader](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_tools_downloader_README.html) and [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html)\n",
    "  - Run an inference application on multiple hardware devices using the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html)\n"

    "## Live traffic detection application\n",
    "The traffic detection application uses the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform inference on an input video to locate any number of vehicles within each frame.  We will setup, run, and view the results for this application for several different hardware devices (CPU. GPU, etc.) available on the compute nodes within the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge.  To accomplish this, we will be performing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [Model Downloader](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_tools_downloader_README.html) to download the inference model IR files needed to perform inference\n",
    "2. Create the job file used to submit running inference on compute nodes\n",
    "3. Submit jobs for different compute nodes and monitor the job status until complete\n",
    "4. View results and assess performance \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "At startup the traffic detection application configures itself by parsing the command line arguments.  Once configured, the application loads the specified inference model's IR files into the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) and runs inference on the specified number of frames of the input video to detect vehicles.  For each vehicle detected, a record is made of the frame number, the location, the class identifier, probability value, and time stamp.  After the specified number of frames have been inferred, a second pass over each frame takes the recored data and annotates the frame by drawing a box over each detected vehicle and labeling it with the class identifier and probability value. The annotated frames are written to an output video that may be then viewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the application on the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge, a job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.  After inference on the input is completed, the output is stored in the appropriate `results/<JobNum>/` directory.  The results are then viewed within this Jupyter* Notebook using the `videoHTML` video playback utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application and inference code for this sample is already implemented in the Python* file [`live_traffic_detection.py`](./live_traffic_detection.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will guide you through configuring and running the traffic detection demo."
