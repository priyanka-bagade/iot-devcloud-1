    "This demo shows how a smart video IoT solution may be created using Intel® hardware and software tools to perform pneumonia classification.  This solution uses an inference model that has been trained to classify the presence of pneumonia using a patient's chest X-ray.  The results are visualized from what the network has learned using the Class Activation Maps (CAM) technique.\n",

    "### Key concepts\n",
    "This demo includes an example for the following:\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - Image input is supported using OpenCV\n",
    "  - Visualization of the resulting class activation maps\n",

    "### Application background \n",
    "Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the small air sacs known as alveoli.\n",
    "Typically symptoms include some combination of cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing [1].\n",
    "Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year [2]. To diagnose this disease, chest X-ray images remain the best diagnostic tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](example-pneumonia.jpeg) *Chest X-ray image of a patient with Pneumonia*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this application, we use a model trained to classify patients with pneumonia over healthy cases based on their chest X-ray images. The topology used is the DenseNet 121 which is an architecture that has shown to be very efficient at this problem.  DenseNet 121 is the first work to claim a classification rate better than practicing radiologists.

    "### Classification and class activation maps\n",
    "\n",
    "A Class Activation Map (CAM) [1] is a technique to visualize the regions that are relevant within a Convolutional Neural Network to identify the specific class in the image. \n",
    "The CAM $M(x,y)$ is calculated from the *N* feature maps $f_i(x,y)$ within the last convolutional layer of the network.  The weighted sum of those feature maps based on the weights of the fully connected layer $w_i$, represents how important those feature maps are for the given classification output. \n",

    "def class_activation_map_openvino(res, convb, fc, net, fp16):\n",
    "    res_bn = res[convb]\n",
    "    conv_outputs=res_bn[0,:,:,:]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Class Activation Map, we access the output feature maps of the last convolution layer `convb` and the weights of the fully connected layer `fc`. \n",
    "By default, only the output layer is present in the returned output of the network. In order to get the feature maps, the last convolution layer must be added to the output. \n",
    "This is done by using the function [`add_outputs(`*convb*`)`](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/ie_python_api/classie__api_1_1IENetwork.html) on the network before loading it to the the device plugin. \n",
    "In order to obtain the layer's name, we recommend [Netron](https://pypi.org/project/netron/), which allows to visualize graphically the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our pneumonia classification model, the name of the last convolutional layer `convb` is \"relu_1/Relu\" and the name of the fully-connected layer `fc` is \"predictions_1/MatMul\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get the feature maps, inference must be performed first to get the results. The `res` argument in the code above is the inference output which includes the feature maps by using `add_outputs()`.\n",
    "We access the `fc` layer weights using the call [`net.layers.get(fc).blobs[\"weights\"]`](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/ie_python_api/classie__api_1_1IENetLayer.html) on the network `net`.  Before doing the weighted sum, if the FP16 model is being used, the weights and feature maps value must be converted from type `float16`to type `float` using the function `float16_conversion_array()`. The weighted sum of the weights is then done with the feature maps. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the function is an image of same size as the feature maps (here, $7\\times7$).  An example is shown below on the left.\n",
    "The CAM image is upsampled to the original input image size and overlaid over the input image. The region of highest value (here, in yellow) will be the region that is the most relevant to deciding on the classification result value. \n",
