    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample application demonstrates how a smart video IoT solution may be created using Intel® hardware and software tools to perform restricted zone notification.  This solution detects any number of people within a video frame and for each person determines whether they have entered into the restricted zone.  The results for each frame are stored in a text file that is later read by a second pass to annotate the input video with the inference time, the decision on whether any present people are safe and outside the restricted zone, and an additional warning message whenever a person has entered the restricted zone and is not safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key concepts\n",
    "This sample application includes an example for the following:\n",
    "- Application:\n",
    "  - Video and image input is supported using OpenCV\n",
    "  - OpenCV is used to draw bounding boxes around detected objects, labels, and other information\n",
    "  - Visualization of inferred results within the output\n",
    "- Intel® DevCloud for the Edge:\n",
    "  - Submitting inference as jobs that are performed on different edge compute nodes (rather than on the development node hosting this Jupyter* notebook)\n",
    "  - Monitoring job status\n",
    "  - Viewing results and assessing performance for hardware on different compute nodes\n",
    "- [Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit](https://software.intel.com/openvino-toolkit):\n",
    "  - Create the necessary Intermediate Representation (IR) files for the inference model using the [Model Downloader](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_tools_downloader_README.html) and [Model Optimizer](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html)\n",

    "## Restricted zone notifier application\n",
    "The restricted zone notifier application uses the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™ toolkit to perform inference on an input video to locate people within each frame and determine whether they have entered the restriction zone.  We will setup, run, and view the results for this application for several different hardware devices (CPU. GPU, etc.) available on the compute nodes within the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge.  To accomplish this, we will be performing the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the [Model Downloader](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_tools_downloader_README.html) to download the inference model IR files needed to perform inference\n",
    "2. Create the job file used to submit running inference on compute nodes\n",
    "3. Submit jobs for different compute nodes and monitor the job status until complete\n",
    "4. View results and assess performance \n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "At startup the restricted zone notifier application configures itself by parsing the command line arguments.  Once configured, the application loads the specified inference model's IR files into the [Inference Engine](http://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_IE_DG_Deep_Learning_Inference_Engine_DevGuide.html) and runs inference on the specified input video to people.  When a person is detected, their location is compared to the predetermined restricted zone to decide whether they are \"safe\".  The user can specify the restricted area coordinates via command line parameters. By default the whole frame is selected. For each frame, a message containing the location, whether workers are \"safe\" or not, etc. is written as a line to the output text.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the restricted zone notifier application has run on a video, a second executable is run to annotate the input video with the results from the output text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the application on the Intel® DevCloud for the Edge, a job is submitted to an edge compute node with a hardware accelerator such as Intel® HD Graphics GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick 2 and and Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA.  After inference on the input is completed, the output is stored in the appropriate `results/<architecture>/` directory.  The results are then viewed within this Jupyter* Notebook using the `videoHTML` video playback utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application and inference code for this sample is already implemented in the files: \n",
    "- First pass, detection using inference: [`restricted_zone_notifier.py`](./restricted_zone_notifier.py) and [`inference.py`](./inference.py).\n",
    "- Second pass, annotation using detection results: [`ROI_writer.cpp`](./ROI_writer.cpp)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will guide you through configuring and running the restricted zone notifier demo."
